Workspace Launcher for Visual Studio Code

---

### What is this repository for? ###

* A utility to list and launch Visual Studio Code workspaces.
* Currently only supports VS Code on Windows (tested on Windows 10 and 11)

---

### Roadmap ###

* Add Linux support
* Clean up appearance
* Allow sort by latest used date instead of parent folder > workspace name

---

### Why is this a thing? ###

There are people who are chronically well-organized. They know what they're
creating before they start. They create a well-designed directory structure
and stick with it...

And then there's me. üò≥

I create projects any old place. I mean, I'm gonna throw half of them away
anyhow, since they're mostly just experiments. Then, when I decide to keep
one, I'll just move it to a more organized folder (sort of). I mean, I'll do
that, but then, during a weekend bout of insomnia, I'll decide to completely
reorganize my previously organized directories, because I'm certain I
totally got them wrong the first (or second... or third...) time. And that's
just a taste of what living in my head feels like.

One unfortunate side effect of this is that when Visual Studio Code offers
me a selection of recently opened workspaces, some of them aren't really
where the software thinks they are.

Moreover, I often want to open one that I haven't visited recently, and
the recent workspaces selection doesn't help me there at all.

In the long run, there are a lot of orphans in the VS Code files that store
workspace locations, even after I've re-visited the moved ones so that the
program is aware of their new locations.

I wanted a quick and easy utility that I could use to launch VS code to any
past workspace that still exists (where it claims to be), ignoring the
missing and orphaned records. Since that isn't an available option in the
software itself, I figured I'd just make one myself.

So, here we are. üòÅ

### Setup/Requirements ###

* Create a virtual environment
    * ```py -m venv .venv```
* Activate the virtual environment
    * ```.venv\Scripts\activate```
* Install the required Python modules:
    * You can install the requirements all at once using:
        * ```py -m pip install -r requirements.txt```
    * Or you can install the individual requirements
        * PySimpleGUI
            * ```py -m pip install pysimplegui```
        * sm-utils
            * ```py -m pip install sm_utils```
* If you want to compile this to an executable, install the following additional Python modules:
    * PyInstaller
        * ```py -m pip install pyinstaller```
    * PyInstaller VersionFile
        * ```py -m pip install pyinstaller-versionfile```

### Usage ###

* To run the application without creating an executable:
    * If *settings.json* is in the same directory as the Python files, run the following command from the terminal:<br>
      ```python.exe workspace_program.py```<br>
      or<br>
      ```python.exe one-file\vscode_workspace_launcher.py```
    * To point to your JSON file with a different name or at a different location, add its relative path as an argument:<br>
      ```python.exe workspace_program.py settings\my_settings.json```<br>
      or<br>
      ```python.exe one-file\vscode_workspace_launcher.py  settings\my_settings.json```

* To generate a stand-alone executable, run the following command in the one-file directory:
    * ```pyinstaller --onefile vscode_workspace_launcher.py --windowed --add-data "rocket.ico:." --icon=rocket.ico --version-file=version.txt```<br><br>
* To update the properties (version number, etc.) of the executable, do the following before generating the .exe:
    * Edit "version.yaml" with the values you want for the properties, then run the following command:
    * ```create-version-file version.yaml --outfile version.txt```<br><br>
* Make sure a copy of settings.json is in the same directory as the compiled executable<br><br>
* To run with the default VSCode paths, leave path items in settings.json set to ```default```<br><br>
* To run with VSCode paths other than the defaults, edit the settings.json file:
    * exe_path:
        * This is the path to the Visual Studio Code executable
        * Default (Windows):<br>
        ```C:\\Users\\{USERNAME}\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code\\Code.exe```
    * workspace_path:
        * This is the path to the folder containingVisual Studio Code workspaces
        * Default (Windows):<br>
        ```C:\\Users\\{USERNAME}\\AppData\\Roaming\\Code\\User\\workspaceStorage```
    * username:
        * The user whose workspaces should be displayed
        * Default: Current Windows User<br><br>

* To change the position where the window appears when launched, modify the ```x_location``` and/or ```y_location``` values in settings.json
    * x_location: (```"x_location": n```) where n is an integer:
        * n > 0: places the top, left corner n pixels from the left of the screen.
        * n < 0: places the top, left corner |n| pixels from the right of the screen.
        * n = 0: will be treated as a 10-pixel offset from the left
    * y_location: (```"y_location": n```) where n is an integer:
        * n > 0: places the top, left corner n pixels from the top of the screen.
        * n < 0: places the top, left corner |n| pixels from the bottom of the screen.
        * n = 0: will be treated as a 10-pixel offset from the top

* The following additional parameters can be set in the settings.json file:
    * ```hide_missing```
        * When ```true```, workspaces whose folders are missing will not be included in the select list
    * ```clean_up_orphans```
        * When ```true```, workspaces whose folders are missing will have their VS Code workspace folders removed
        * This is obviously an aggressive step, so leave this ```false``` unless you're absolutely sure you don't want them around
    * ```show_repos```
        * When ```true```, names in the select list will include their repository URLs
    * ```show_glyphs```
        * When ```true```, repository URLs (if displayed) will be prepended with the nerd-font glyphs for their sites.
        * Currently only supports the following glyphs:
            * Bitbucket
            * GitHub
        * Note: This feature requires that the ```font``` setting (below) be an installed nerd font with the glyphs available
            * I use the "CaskaydiaCove Nerd Font" for example
                * A copy is included as fonts\CaskaydiaCove.zip
    * ```font```
        * Name of the (installed) font to be used in the UI
    * ```font_size```
        * Display size of the font in the UI as ```"font_size": <int>```
        * I recommend not setting this lower than 10 or higher than 20
